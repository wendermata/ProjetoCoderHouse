                    <p class="card-text">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                        printer
                        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
                        five
                        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
                        was
                        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                        and more
                        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                        Ipsum.
                        Why do we use it?
                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                        when
                        looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                        distribution
                        of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
                        English. Many
                        desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
                        text, and a
                        search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
                        have
                        evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
                        like).
                        Where does it come from?
                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                        classical
                        Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                        professor at
                        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
                        from a
                        Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered
                        the
                        undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
                        et
                        Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on
                        the
                        theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
                        ipsum dolor
                        sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                        Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
                        in their
                        exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
